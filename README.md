# Definetly_not_Gravitar
Basic implementation of the clasic Atari game Gravitar from 1982.

This code was done as a final proyect for the subyect Algoritmos y Programacion I - 95.11 Curso: Essaya from the Facutlad de Ingenieria de la Universidad de Buenos Aires (FIUBA).

It was developed by Ramiro Mantero and myself.

To play the game, first you will have to download SDL2. After that, open the terminal, go to the directory were you saved the files and run:
$ make
This will create many .o files and an executable file called Gravitar.
After that just type $ ./Gravitar in the terminal to execute the program and enjoy the game.
